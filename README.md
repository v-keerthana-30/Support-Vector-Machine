# Support-Vector-Machine
It involves building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict mushroom types using the Mushroom dataset.

It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Load the dataset, explore feature distributions with histograms, box plots, and density plots, and investigate feature correlations.

Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Visualization: Use scatter plots, pair plots, and class distribution plots to understand data patterns and balance.

SVM Implementation: Train a basic SVM classifier, evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Parameter Tuning: Optimize SVM performance by experimenting with hyperparameters like kernel type and regularization.

Analysis: Compare SVM results across different kernels, discuss model strengths and weaknesses, and practical implications for real-world classification.
